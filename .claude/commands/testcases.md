1. Use zen if you want to read a large codebase.
2. Please add or update test cases to gradually increase test coverage, working step by step.
3. Always validate your changes by running tests. You can use the test command listed in package.json to test the whole project or specific test file.
4. If you encounter any ambiguity or uncertainty, feel free to ask for clarification before proceeding.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 3 until test coverage reaches 100%.
